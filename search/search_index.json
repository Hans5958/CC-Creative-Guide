First of all, you can use \"/plot flag add [flag] [value]\" to add a flag, \"/plot flag delete [flag]\" to delete a flag, and \"/plot flag set [flag] [value]\" to set a flag. I will list some flags you need to know, and you can check the rest on \"/plot flag list\". If some of the flags aren't set, nothing would happen. Flag Description titles The text when you enter a plot (Owned by ...). This can be enabled or disabled by either \"true\" or \"false\" as the values. greeting The chat text when you enter a plot. You can make any greeting text as the value. (even with colour codes) farewell The chat text when you leave a plot. You can make any farewell text as the value.

The values are rain and clear. music The music that will be played on your plot. The values are the music disc IDs (2256-2267). It would be easier to use /plot music. place break use The block IDs that the visitor can place/break/use. If you want your visitors only able to use a chest, do \"/plot flag set use 54\". If you want your visitors only able to use a chest and a wooden button, do \"/plot flag set use 54,143\". Notice that I don't use a space to separate the items. Set the value to 0 if you want your visitors can place/break/use anything. price The price of your plot, if you want to sell it. The values are... the price of your plot. The visitors can use /plot buy to buy a plot, if a price is set. no-worldedit Disables WorldEdit on your plot.

Introduction Okay, where do we start? So, welcome to the CosmicMC's (or Cosmic Craft's) creative server. In here, you would expect some good and bad things. In this server, you may get great buildings across the server. You can also meet a lot of friends! Seriously. Most of them are friendly here. You can also see staff that often online, watching the game, to give you (a little) better experience on this server. You can also meet some players whose name are bolded. These are called Donators. Donators are a ranked player who wants to contribute more to the server, so they bought the rank (or maybe, donate) to the server. Yes, you can expect a high-quality building that made by them, despite the non-donors are also good on build stuff. Most of them are friendly, but some of them are toxic. These toxic guys are the famous on the whole server, that everyone made of a stereotype because of them. These toxic players are the most annoying person because they have a \"bolded\" name that made them attention whore and cringe. But don't worry, there are just a few. Like I said, most of them are friendly and you can ask questions if you are curious. Let's take a little deep about the negative side about this server. As I said, few donators are a toxic being on this server, but there's more. Some of the players may advertise their server wildly on this server. Despite the staff that is often online, you must prepare the incoming advertisements, if you hate them so much. There's also the command /ignore to mute them on your side, I will explain that later. You can also see players using /me abusively (which we will discuss it later), so be prepared. I forgot to tell that this server is supported up to 1.12.2. So, expect long messages that the players will post on this server. I don't say that this server is family-friendly, so expect some bad-words that the players will speak. Some players may also spam their roleplay/shop/buildings/plot on the server.","title":"I. Introduction"},{"location":"preface/","text":"Preface Hello, and welcome to this guide. First of all, thank you so much to read this guide. You may want to know why do I make this guide. Well, I made this guide for newcomers on this server, and also to introduce you to this server. This also made for players who have a high curiosity to find something interesting about this server. This guide is also made with a good source from staff and players from this server, so you can trust this guide for your reliable information. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible and as up to date as possible, from the start to the end.

This has been confirmed by some staff and AllenCC itself. Like, seriously. Who would care if someone hacks or cheat for themselves?

WorldEdit WorldEdit, the builders best friend. Whenever you either lazy or hate to put thousands of blocks, this tool is perfect. So, WorldEdit is a world manipulation tool that you could use to build something easier. It's a popular plugin that everybody uses. Most of the creative servers has this plugin, including CosmicMC. Some of them needs the players to vote for a duration of WorldEdit abilities, others needs to pay to use it. It's a must-have plugin, I swear. In this server, you would be charged $5 per operation.
