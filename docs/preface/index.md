# Preface

Hello, and welcome to this guide. First of all, thank you so much to read this guide. You may want to know why do I make this guide. Well, I made this guide for newcomers on this server, and also to introduce you to this server. This also made for players who have a high curiosity to find something interesting about this server.

This guide is also made with a good source from staff and players from this server, so you can trust this guide for your reliable information. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible and as up to date as possible, from the start to the end. So, if something is missing in this guide, do not hesitate to tell me so I can fix it as soon as possible.

Thanks for reading this preface, and enjoy this guide.
