<h2>II.4. Commands - Marriage</h2>

I don't know you guys, but since everyone wants to marry, I decided to add this to this guide because everyone does it.
Okay, so marry is a feature that's added to the server for fun, but some players took it seriously and they "adopt" a child for being a huge family.
Please don't do those guys, I'm disappointed. Anyway, let's get to the commands. I don't know if this works or not, so please tell me if the commands don't work.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /marry [player] | Sends a proposal of marriage to someone. You can accept this by doing /marry accept.
| /marry gender | Sets your gender. *
| /marry gift | Gifts/gave an item that you are holding to your partner. *
