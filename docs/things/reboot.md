<h2>III.3. Reboot</h2>

Unlike other (creative) servers, we have a recurring reboot schedule. This may happen because unlike many servers, the server has a load, so it needs a refresh.

In GMT time, the reboot happens on **07:00** *(7 a.m.)*, **15:00** *(3 p.m.)*, and **23:00** *(11 p.m.)*. There will be a notice that there will be a reboot in one minute before the reboot happens.
