<h2>III.3. Reboot</h2>

Unlike other (creative) servers, we have a recurring reboot schedule. This may happen because unlike many servers, the server has a load, so it needs a refresh.

In GMT time, the reboot happens on 00:00 (12 p.m.), 08:00 (8 a.m.), and 16:00 (4 p.m.). There will be a notice that there will be a reboot in one minute before the reboot happens.
