WorldEdit, the builders best friend. Whenever you either lazy or hate to put thousands of blocks, this tool is perfect.

So, WorldEdit is a world manipulation tool that you could use to build something easier. It's a popular plugin that everybody uses. Most of the creative servers has this plugin, including CosmicMC. Some of them needs the players to vote for a duration of WorldEdit abilities, others needs to pay to use it. It's a must-have plugin, I swear.

In this server, you would be charged **$5** per operation. The block limit is **1.000.000** (1 million) blocks. **Do not pass this block limit!** If you pass it, it fails and **you would still get charged!**

### Basics

So let's learn about the basics. To use it, we need to run the command **//wand** to get a wooden axe. You also could use any wooden axe. The wooden axe will be used to set the region that you want to modify. To set the **first position**, you **left-click** a block. To set the **second position**, you **right-click** a block.  You could also use **/pos1** and **/pos2** to set the positions.

Let's introduce the commands that you could use for everybody.

- Use **/set [block]** to set the selection region into your selected block.
- Use **/replace [block to replace] [new block]** to replace a block into a new block.
- Use **/hsphere** to make a hollow sphere.
- Use **/sphere** to make a filled sphere.
- Use **/hcyl** to make a hollow cylinder.
- Use **/cyl** to make a filled cylinder.
- Use **/hpyramid** to make a hollow pyramid.
- Use **/pyramid** to make a filled pyramid.
- Use **/undo** to undo a command. (You can't redo!)
